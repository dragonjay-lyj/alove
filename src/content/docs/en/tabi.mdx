## The Feeling of Tabi

Tabi socks offer a unique sensation. The snug fit and pleasant feel against the skin are comparable to the satisfaction of a tightly tied kaku obi, instantly sharpening the senses. This feeling is simply unattainable with ordinary socks. Some even wear traditional Japanese clothing just to experience the joy of wearing tabi. Furthermore, tabi play a crucial role in completing the elegance of traditional Japanese attire. Far from being mere undergarments, they are an integral part of the overall ensemble, much like the kimono itself.

When it comes to men's tabi, white tabi for formal occasions, and black or navy blue tabi for other occasions are generally considered the norm. But did you know that there are actually many more varieties of tabi? It's definitely not the case that 'all tabi are the same.' Changing just your tabi can drastically alter the look of your Japanese attire, and more importantly, it completely changes the mood. Here, we will introduce you to the world of tabi that are generally available, excluding the special tabi still used in the entertainment industry.

Occasionally, why not coordinate your kimono or hakama with colored tabi for a touch of style!

## What makes for comfortable tabi?

While a comfortable tabi is subjective, I find the following generally holds true.  The ideal tabi is crafted from sturdy calico cotton, lined with soft, bleached cotton, and secured with four kohaze hooks.  A slightly snug fit is preferred, but above all, the tabi must complement the shape of the foot.

Ideally, one would have tabi custom-made at a specialty shop, but for beginners, it's best to try on ready-made tabi from various stores to find the perfect fit. Even within the same size, dimensions can vary subtly between brands, each offering a unique feel and comfort. The joy of finding your perfect tabi lies in the exploration itself.

For your reference, the price of tabi socks at a specialized store is generally around 3,000 to 4,000 yen per pair for ready-made ones. Custom-made tabi cost about 10% to 20% more than ready-made ones. While it varies depending on the store, they usually accept orders for custom-made tabi starting from around ten pairs. Although a bit pricey, the comfort of wearing tabi from any of these stores is simply unparalleled, so I highly recommend trying them out. It's true that 3,000 yen per pair isn't exactly cheap, but if you take good care of them, they can last quite a while. Considering their comfort, I've personally convinced myself that they're a reasonable investment.

While white tabi are de rigueur for uniforms in disciplines like Kyudo (Japanese archery), they're not typically worn for everyday kimono wear. That said, there's no rule against it. Especially in summer, white tabi can lend a crisp and cool air to one's appearance.

As the most formal footwear, gracing occasions from the most solemn ceremonies (like those requiring a black montsuki hakama) to the most elite gatherings, white tabi are considered the pinnacle of luxury. This stems from their proclivity for staining, requiring frequent changes throughout the day for the sartorially meticulous.  Moreover, appearing in public with soiled tabi is a social faux pas, making the more practical colored tabi the standard choice for daily wear.

## About Tabi for Everyday Wear

Speaking of everyday tabi, it's often said that 'navy blue cotton is the norm in Kanto, while black satin reigns supreme in Kansai.' These black satin tabi, with their characteristic sheen, are perhaps the most popular choice for men, but I must confess, they've never quite appealed to me. The sight of those gleaming black feet strikes me as more uncouth than refined, clashing terribly with the elegance of hakama trousers.  Personally, I find navy blue tabi to be the most agreeable choice.  Suitable for all but the most formal occasions, they complement a wide range of kimono styles.  While often appearing almost black, as seen in the photo on the left, navy blue tabi offer a surprising variety of shades to suit any taste.  With each wash, the color deepens, enhancing both their appearance and comfort.  However, for outings, a fresh pair is always preferable.

## About Colored Tabi

Men's tabi also come in colors and patterns. While black and navy blue are considered standard, 'colored tabi' for men usually refers to shades beyond these. Technically, of course, black and navy blue are colors too.  Women have long enjoyed a vibrant array of tabi colors, and recently, men's options have also expanded considerably.  It's worth noting that colored tabi, for both men and women, are purely a fashion choice.  While some kimono shops might encourage experimenting with colorful tabi,  it's crucial to coordinate them carefully with your kimono or hakama.  Choosing a color based solely on the tabi without considering the overall outfit can easily lead to a mismatched look. 

So, what kind of colored tabi are available? Well, you can find shades brighter than navy, like a vivid indigo or greenish hues like uguisu-iro (warbler green). Then there are browns, from rich chestnut to lighter shades of tea, and even a range of greys.  Keep in mind that the exact shades can vary quite a bit from shop to shop. For example, even within the realm of navy, you'll find subtle differences. Bundoya in Kyoto offers only a deep, almost iron-like navy, while Ohnoya in Tokyo's Shintomicho has a brighter indigo-navy.  And if you head over to Meugaya in Asakusa, also in Tokyo, you'll discover an even brighter navy.

'Fukusuke' (White Tabi)

</div>

These tabi feature soles dyed to match the fabric.  Besides navy and brown, shades like grey are also available.  Black soles are another option. From left to right: light brown, reddish brown, grey, matcha green, navy, white.

The soles of tabi aren't limited to white either. You can find navy or dark brown tabi with jet-black soles, navy tabi with light bluish-grey soles, and grey tabi with light grey soles - a subtle touch of color matching the tabi's fabric. Incidentally, black tabi with black soles, often sported by stagehands, are colloquially known as \"Karasu Tabi\" (\"Raven Tabi\").

Patterned tabi, on the other hand, are primarily reserved for the stage, gracing the feet of dancers and performers.  Yet, even within this specialized realm, the variety is astounding.  Imagine striped cotton tabi, or those adorned with delicate patterns: pine needles scattered across a deep mugwort ground, or hemp leaves dancing upon an indigo canvas.  Some tabi shops even offer bespoke services, crafting unique pairs from scraps of kimono fabric provided by the customer.  However, be warned, these custom creations, while undeniably chic, may not possess the longevity of their more conventional counterparts.

## A Word on Tabi Materials

While tabi come in materials like cotton, linen, velvet, silk, and synthetics, cotton canvas reigns supreme.  Sure, cheaper polyester tabi are easy to care for and delightfully soft, revealing every curve of your toes.  And yes, leather tabi exist, though they're about as common as a sober sailor.  Rumor has it they'd make a strong man weep after a day's wear, but I wouldn't knowâ€”never been tempted to find out.

Regarding the lining fabric of tabi, people typically wear tabi with sun-bleached lining in summer and flannel lining in winter. However, I wear sun-bleached lined tabi even in the dead of winter. While flannel-lined tabi feel nice against the skin, I find them a bit too thick for my liking. That being said, some people, such as Noh actors, wear flannel-lined tabi year-round, as they absorb foot moisture and create a softer silhouette.

When it comes to kohaze (those little metal hooks), four is truly the magic number.  Three just don't seem quite secure, and you risk flashing a bit too much ankle. Five, on the other hand, can make sitting comfortably a challenge, and they tend to look a tad clunky with casual kimono.  While you can find tabi with as many as six kohaze these days, it really boils down to personal preference.  The photo below shows a pair of colored tabi with five kohaze from Meugaya in Asakusa.

Fastening the kohaze

When choosing your size, opt for your usual shoe size or half a centimeter smaller.  A snug fit is best - it minimizes wrinkles and becomes surprisingly comfortable once you're used to it.  However, avoid squeezing into overly tight tabi, as this can lead to chafing, tears, and even foot pain. (Trust me on this one! ^^;) While centimeters are now the standard unit for tabi sizing, many traditional shops still use the \"mon\" unit, a charming relic from the days when length was measured by how many mon coins fit side by side.

## A World of Tabi

Now, let's delve into some other intriguing tabi varieties.  These are all for men, and while I own most of them, they rarely see the light of day.(^^;

-   Hemp Tabi: Stylish summer tabi made from 100% hemp. Light and cool for the hot season, but prone to wrinkling and revealing the shape of the toes, making them challenging to wear gracefully.  Choose a size that fits snugly, even more so than cotton tabi. Available from brands like Fukuske.

-   Stretch Tabi: Made from stretchy nylon fabric. While the soft material prevents discomfort from the metal clasps, it also tends to reveal the shape of the toes. Easy to care for as they can be air-dried after washing.

-   Unsai Tabi... These are sturdy cotton tabi with thick fabric on both the upper and sole, often worn by craftsmen, especially during winter. The ones in the photo are made by Fukusuke and feature a thick cotton fabric on the sole called \"Ishi-zoko\" (literally \"stone sole\"). Generally, tabi soles come in three types: \"Unsai-zoko\" (also \"Unsai-zoko\") with a diagonal stripe pattern, \"Sugi-zoko\" with a W-shaped twill weave, and \"Ishi-zoko\" with a rough surface. In general, \"Sugi-zoko\" is commonly used in western Japan, while \"Unsai-zoko\" is preferred in eastern Japan.

## Tabi Care

Tossing your tabi in the wash is perfectly fine â€“ just use a laundry net. However, be mindful of new, colored tabi, especially navy ones, as they tend to bleed. Before drying, give the toes and soles a good shake to smooth out wrinkles.  For best results, slip them directly onto a repurposed wire hanger. If you must use clothespins, clip them only on the edge with the kohaze loops â€“ any marks will be less noticeable there. And a final tip: avoid turning tabi inside out to dry, as this can distort their shape. Once dry, skip the iron and simply wear them â€“ your feet will naturally mold them back into shape.  Ironing can leave an unwanted sheen.

Speaking of new tabi, they often come starched.  A quick wash removes the starch and helps them to better conform to your feet. If you'd rather skip the pre-wash, wearing your brand new tabi in the bath works just as well.  You'll find that a well-worn pair, softened with multiple washes, is far more comfortable than a brand new one.  I tend to hang onto my tabi even after they're worn thin and a bit worse for wear.  They're just too comfortable to throw away!  I usually end up wearing these well-loved pairs around the house.  For me, the telltale signs of a well-worn tabi are the holes that form around the base of my little toe.  If your tabi are too tight, you're likely to find tears around your toes or along the sides of your feet.  It really depends on how you wear them, but areas that experience constant friction or pressure tend to wear out first.  While I'll mend and patch my tabi to get a bit more wear out of them, they are ultimately a consumable item, much like undergarments, and should be treated as such.

## The art of wearing Tabi

Back when most students wore traditional Japanese clothing to school, wearing tabi with unfastened kohaze (imagine stepping on the backs of your sneakers!) or letting your hakama strings dangle was considered a serious fashion faux pas. While such a sight is rare these days, it's worth remembering that incorrectly worn tabi can damage not only the footwear itself but also your precious feet.
