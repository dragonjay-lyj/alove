## The Art of Tabi: More Than Meets the Eye

Wearing tabi socks is a unique experience. The snug, comfortable fit against the skin is often compared to the feeling of tightening a kakuobi (sash), creating a sense of crispness and composure. It’s a sensation unattainable with ordinary socks. In fact, some people are even inspired to wear kimono just for the pleasure of wearing tabi. More than just footwear, tabi are integral to the overall aesthetic of traditional Japanese dress, serving to visually enhance the lines of the kimono. They are not considered undergarments, but rather an essential component of the attire.

While white tabi are typically associated with formal menswear, and black or navy blue with other occasions, the world of tabi socks is far more diverse than it first appears. Far from being uniform, tabi offer a surprising range of styles and materials, each with the power to subtly transform the look and feel of a kimono ensemble. Beyond the specialized tabi used in the entertainment industry, a wealth of options are available to the discerning wearer. This article delves into the fascinating world of readily available tabi, exploring the nuances that set them apart.

Add a touch of personality to your kimono or hakama ensemble with a pair of vibrant colored tabi. These exquisite examples, crafted by the renowned Fukusuke brand, are available at Asakusa's Meu Gaya store.

## The Hallmarks of Exceptional Tabi

While comfort is subjective, there are certain qualities that tend to define exceptional tabi. These include: a durable yet soft Kyaraco cotton exterior, a breathable bleached cotton lining, four kohaze (metal hooks) for a secure fit, a slightly snug size, and above all, a shape that conforms perfectly to the foot.

While a custom-made pair from a specialized tabi shop is the ultimate indulgence, beginners are encouraged to experiment with ready-made options from various stores. Sizing and fit can vary subtly between brands, each offering a unique feel and character. The journey of discovering the perfect tabi for your foot is a delightful exploration in itself.

As a general guide, ready-made tabi from a specialized shop will cost between 3,000 and 4,000 yen. Custom-made pairs, offering a truly bespoke fit, are priced approximately 10% to 20% higher. While minimum order quantities for custom tabi vary, most shops require around ten pairs. The investment is well justified, as the unparalleled comfort of handcrafted tabi elevates them to a different league altogether. While a 3,000 yen price tag may seem steep, proper care ensures their longevity, making them a worthwhile investment for discerning wearers.

## White Tabi: A Timeless Classic

White Tabi (Left: From "Bundoya" in Kyoto, Right: From "Meu Gaya" in Asakusa)

While white tabi are an integral part of the uniform for disciplines like Kyudo (Japanese archery), they are not typically worn as everyday attire with kimono. That said, there are no strict rules against wearing white tabi, and they can be a particularly stylish choice during the summer months, lending a touch of crisp elegance to any ensemble.

Representing the pinnacle of formality in tabi, white tabi are reserved for the most auspicious occasions, such as weddings and ceremonies requiring black crested haori hakama. Ironically, their pristine nature makes them a symbol of luxury when worn daily, as it necessitates frequent changes to maintain their immaculate appearance. Given the social faux pas of appearing in soiled tabi, colored tabi are a more practical choice for everyday wear, requiring less meticulous upkeep.

Shigeru Yoshida, a former prime minister renowned for his sartorial elegance, was known for exclusively wearing white tabi, earning him the moniker "White Tabi." This unwavering commitment to pristine footwear arguably contributed to his aura of authority and style. Indeed, the stark whiteness of fresh tabi commands attention and adds a touch of gravitas to any ensemble.

While emulating Yoshida's dedication to white tabi is admirable, modern etiquette allows for more flexibility. White tabi remain de rigueur for formal occasions, particularly those involving montsuki kimono with one or more family crests. However, for less formal events, even those requiring hakama, colored tabi are perfectly acceptable and offer an opportunity for personal expression.

## Choosing the Ideal Everyday Tabi: A Matter of Taste

Tradition dictates that everyday tabi should be navy blue Kyaraco in the Kanto region and black satin in Kansai. While black satin tabi, known as "kurojūsu" or "kuroshusu," are undoubtedly a popular choice for men, their glossy finish can appear somewhat informal, particularly when paired with hakama. The gleaming black tends to detract from the overall elegance of the ensemble.

Navy blue tabi offer a more versatile and refined alternative, suitable for most occasions outside of formal events. They complement a wide range of kimono colors and patterns. While often appearing almost black, navy tabi encompass a spectrum of subtle shades, allowing for personal preference. The fabric develops a pleasing patina with each wash, enhancing both its appearance and comfort. However, it is generally considered good form to wear relatively new tabi for outings.

## Exploring the World of Colored Tabi: A Note of Caution

While black and navy blue are considered standard colors for men's tabi, a vibrant spectrum of colored and patterned options is also available. While technically all tabi with a hue are considered "colored tabi," the term generally refers to those beyond the classic black and navy. Although women have long enjoyed a wide variety of colored tabi, men's options have expanded considerably in recent years.

It's worth noting that colored tabi, for both men and women, are primarily a fashion statement. While some kimono shops encourage experimenting with colored tabi to create striking ensembles, careful coordination is crucial. A mismatch between tabi and kimono can easily appear jarring and detract from the overall harmony of the look. Choosing a color based solely on the tabi without considering the rest of the outfit is a common pitfall best avoided.

The spectrum of colored tabi encompasses a wide range of hues, from vibrant indigo blues to earthy greens like yellowish green. Browns range from rich maroon and deep chocolate to lighter, more subdued tones. Gray tabi, in various shades, offer a versatile and understated option.

It's important to note that colors can vary significantly between shops. For example, while "Bundoya" in Kyoto specializes in a deep, iron navy blue, "Onoya" in Tokyo's Shintomicho district offers a brighter blue navy, while "Meu Gaya" in Asakusa carries an even brighter shade. Exploring the offerings of different shops reveals a fascinating world of subtle color variations.

The soles of tabi offer further possibilities for subtle color play. Options extend beyond the ubiquitous white to include jet-black soles paired with navy or dark brown uppers, light bluish-gray soles complementing navy tabi, and pale gray soles harmonizing with gray uppers. Some tabi even feature soles in a lighter shade of the upper fabric, creating a tonal effect. It's interesting to note that black tabi with black soles, often worn by stagehands in Kabuki theater, are colloquially known as "crow tabi."

While patterned tabi are primarily associated with dance and theatrical performances, a surprising array of designs exists. From classic striped cotton to whimsical pine needle motifs on a dark mugwort background, and elegant hemp leaf patterns adorning indigo fabric, the options are as diverse as the world of kimono itself. Some specialized tabi shops even offer bespoke services, crafting unique pairs from fabric scraps provided by the customer. However, it's worth noting that tabi fashioned from kimono fabric tend to have a shorter lifespan than their more durable counterparts.

## A Look at Tabi Materials: From Classic Cotton to Contemporary Options

Tabi are crafted from a variety of materials, including cotton, hemp, velvet, silk, and synthetic fibers. However, cotton canvas remains the gold standard, prized for its durability and breathability. While inexpensive polyester tabi offer ease of care, they tend to lack the structured silhouette of their natural fiber counterparts, often revealing the shape of the toes. Though less prevalent, leather tabi are still available, though their tendency to retain odors makes them a less appealing choice for many.

Tabi linings are typically chosen according to the season, with breathable bleached cotton preferred for summer and warmer flannel favored for winter. However, personal preference also plays a role. While flannel offers a cozy feel, some find it bulky and opt for the sleekness of bleached cotton year-round.

It's worth noting that flannel linings are particularly prized by certain performers, such as Noh actors, for their ability to absorb moisture and create a softer, more fluid line. This preference highlights the nuanced considerations that go into selecting the ideal tabi for specific needs and aesthetics.

When it comes to kohaze (metal hooks), four remains the standard for a reason. Three can leave the ankle looking exposed, while five can feel constricting and appear somewhat cumbersome, particularly with informal kimono styles. While tabi with six kohaze do exist, ultimately, the ideal number is a matter of personal preference.

The photo below showcases a pair of stylish colored tabi with five kohaze from "Meu Gaya" in Asakusa, illustrating the diverse options available to today's tabi enthusiast.

Choosing the right tabi size is crucial for both comfort and aesthetics. As a general rule, opt for tabi that are the same size as your shoe size or half a centimeter smaller. A snug fit minimizes wrinkles and, once broken in, provides a supremely comfortable feel. However, beware of going too small, as excessively tight tabi can lead to discomfort, blisters, and premature wear. (Trust me on this one!)

While modern tabi sizing typically utilizes centimeters, many traditional shops still adhere to the "mon" unit, a fascinating vestige of a bygone era when length was measured by the diameter of "mon" coins.

## Delving Deeper into the World of Tabi: Beyond the Basics

While the previous sections have covered the most common types of tabi, a world of more specialized options awaits the curious enthusiast. Here are a few examples, all designed for men. While my collection includes all of these, I confess they rarely see the light of day. (^^;)

-   Velvet Tabi: Popular in the early Showa period (1926-1989) as a stylish way to stay warm, velvet tabi feature a plush velvet sole for added insulation. Primarily marketed towards women, they were once a common sight in department stores and even supermarkets. Today, however, they are largely relegated to specialty tabi shops, though they can still be found in a surprising range of colors.

-   Hemp Tabi: The epitome of cool summer elegance, hemp tabi are crafted from 100% hemp, offering exceptional breathability and a luxuriously lightweight feel. However, their inherent texture makes them prone to wrinkling and can accentuate the shape of the toes, requiring a discerning eye for fit and a certain degree of confidence to pull off. As with cotton tabi, a snug fit is essential, with brands like Fukusuke offering readily available options.

-   Stretch Tabi: Crafted from stretchy nylon, these tabi offer a contemporary alternative to traditional woven fabrics. However, their extreme flexibility can be a double-edged sword. While undeniably comfortable, the lack of structure can result in a less polished look, with the shape of the toes sometimes visible through the fabric. On the plus side, their quick-drying nature makes them a practical choice for travelers or those short on time.

-   Unsai Tabi: Favored by artisans and craftsmen, particularly during the colder months, Unsai tabi are known for their exceptional durability. Crafted from heavyweight cotton, they feature reinforced soles for added resilience. The pair pictured here, made by Fukusuke, showcases the "ishizoko" (literally "stone sole"), characterized by its thick, rugged construction.

Tabi soles, in general, fall into three main categories: "unsaizoko" (also rendered as "unsai-zoko" or "yunsaizoko"), distinguished by its diagonal striped pattern; "sugizoko," featuring a distinctive W-shaped twill weave; and the aforementioned "ishizoko." Interestingly, regional preferences dictate that "sugizoko" is more common in the Kansai region, while "unsaizoko" reigns supreme in Kanto.

## Tabi TLC: Washing and Drying Tips for Long-Lasting Footwear

Caring for your tabi is surprisingly simple. They can be safely laundered in a washing machine, preferably placed inside a laundry net for added protection. However, be mindful that new colored tabi, particularly those in navy blue, are prone to fading and should be washed separately.

When drying your tabi, gently reshape them by patting out any wrinkles on the instep and sole. Ideally, slip them onto a specially designed tabi hanger or a modified wire hanger. If using clothespins, clip them to the reinforced "kakeito" section where the kohaze (metal hooks) are attached. This minimizes the visibility of any clothespin marks. Avoid drying tabi inside out, as this can distort their shape.

Once dry, resist the urge to iron! Instead, slip them onto your feet and let the warmth and natural contours work their magic, smoothing out any remaining wrinkles. Ironing, while tempting, can create an undesirable sheen and compromise the tabi's unique texture.

<Image src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dkhp3hucr/image/upload/v1722911204/Fundoshi/washtabi_wktv2y.avif" loading="lazy" isZoomed alt="Midas" client:visible />

New tabi often come with a layer of starch that can make them feel stiff. A quick wash before the first wear removes the starch and allows the fabric to mold comfortably to your feet. For a less hands-on approach, simply wear your new tabi in the bath!

Paradoxically, well-worn tabi, having been washed and stretched through repeated wear, often feel more comfortable than their pristine counterparts. This explains why many tabi aficionados, myself included, find it hard to part with even the most tattered pairs, relegating them to indoor use as comfy slippers.

While wear and tear are inevitable, understanding where they occur can help prolong the life of your tabi. Personally, I tend to experience wear around the base of my little toe. Excessively tight tabi are more likely to develop holes at pressure points like the toes and sides of the feet.

Ultimately, while mending can extend their lifespan, tabi, like all garments, are subject to the forces of friction and time. Embracing their ephemeral nature allows us to appreciate the artistry and comfort they provide, treating them with care while accepting their eventual retirement.

## The Art of Wearing Tabi: Beyond Mere Footwear

In an era when kimono reigned supreme as everyday attire, even schoolchildren were held to high standards of sartorial etiquette. Wearing tabi with unfastened kohaze (akin to walking with the backs of one's sneakers crushed down) or allowing hakama straps to dangle haphazardly was considered a sign of disrespect and sloppiness.

While such faux pas are rare today, it's essential to remember that properly worn tabi are not just about aesthetics but also about foot health. Incorrectly worn tabi can chafe, cause blisters, and even lead to more serious foot problems. Taking the time to put on your tabi correctly ensures both a polished appearance and a comfortable experience.
